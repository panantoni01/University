The modern English alphabet is a Latin alphabet consisting of 26 letters, each having an upper- and lower-case form. It originated 
around the 7th century from Latin script. Since then, letters have been added or removed to give the current Modern English alphabet 
of 26 letters (which eventually became the ISO basic Latin alphabet). The word alphabet is a compound of the first two letters of the 
Greek alphabet, alpha and beta.
