            The Tatra mountains, is a mountain range in Central Europe that forms a natural border between Slovakia and Poland. 
            They are the highest mountain range in the Carpathian Mountains. 
            The Tatras are distinct from the Low Tatras (Slovak: Nízke Tatry), a separate Slovak mountain range further south.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Tatra Mountains occupy an area of 785 square kilometres (303 sq mi), of which about 610 square kilometres 
            (236 sq mi) (77.7%) lie within Slovakia and about 175 square kilometres (68 sq mi) (22.3%) within Poland. 
            The highest peak, called Gerlach, at 2,655 m (8710 ft), is located north of Poprad, entirely in Slovakia. 
            The highest point in Poland, Rysy, at 2,499 m (8200 ft), is located south of Zakopane, on the border with Slovakia.

            Bieszczady Mountains is a mountain range that runs from the extreme south-east of Poland and north-east of 
            Slovakia through to western Ukraine. It forms the western part of the Eastern Beskids (Polish: Beskidy Wschodnie; 
            Ukrainian: Східні Бескиди), and is more generally part of the Outer Eastern Carpathians. The mountain range 
            is situated between the Łupków Pass (640 m) and the Vyshkovskyi Pass (933 m). The highest peak of Bieszczady 
            is Mt Pikui (1405 m) in Ukraine. The highest peak of the Polish part is Tarnica (1346 m).

            The Giant Mountains (Polish: Karkonosze), are a mountain range located in the north of the Czech Republic and
            the south-west of Poland, part of the Sudetes mountain system (part of the Bohemian Massif). The Czech-Polish border, 
            which divides the historic regions of Bohemia and Silesia, runs along the main ridge. The highest peak, Sněžka 
            (Polish: Śnieżka, German: Schneekoppe), is the Czech Republic's highest point with an elevation of 1,603 metres (5,259 ft).
          </p>
          <p>
            On both sides of the border, large areas of the mountains are designated national parks (the Krkonoše National Park 
            in the Czech Republic and the Karkonosze National Park in Poland), and these together constitute a cross-border 
            biosphere reserve under the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme. The source of the River Elbe is within the 
            Giant Mountains. The range has a number of major ski resorts, and is a popular destination for tourists engaging 
            in downhill and cross-country skiing, hiking, cycling and other activities.
